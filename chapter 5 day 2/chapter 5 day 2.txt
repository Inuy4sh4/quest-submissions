Minimizes the risks of hacks and improves functionality tenfold. Interactions with these contracts is a lot easier because there's a predefined
set of rules that must be respected so that they have the same function names, always return the same type etc. Basically, instead of having
a unique different way of interacting with every nft contract, you can interect in a single way with thousands of nft contracts instead.

3.    Please fix this code (Hint: There are two things wrong):

The contract interface:

pub contract interface ITest {
  pub var number: Int
  
  pub fun updateNumber(newNumber: Int) {
    pre {
      newNumber >= 0: "We don't like negative numbers for some reason. We're mean."
    }
    post {
      self.number == newNumber: "Didn't update the number to be the new number."
    }
  }

  pub resource interface IStuff {
    pub var favouriteActivity: String
  }

  pub resource Stuff {
    pub var favouriteActivity: String
  }
}

The implementing contract:

*** the implementing contract forgot to implement *** 
implement ITest from 0x01

*** would work anyway but it's not implementing the interface without the :ITest ***
pub contract Test: ITest {
  pub var number: Int
  
  pub fun updateNumber(newNumber: Int) {
    self.number = 5
  }

  pub resource interface IStuff {
    pub var favouriteActivity: String
  }
*** forgot to add the contract that has the interface (ITest.Istuff)
  pub resource Stuff: ITest.IStuff {
    pub var favouriteActivity: String

    init() {
      self.favouriteActivity = "Playing League of Legends."
    }
  }

  init() {
    self.number = 0
  }
}
