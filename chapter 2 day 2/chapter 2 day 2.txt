1. Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.

	/// we will not call changeGreeting in a script because scripts do not modify the state of the contract, they return something instead

2. What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?

	/// it refers to WHO will authorize and pay the transaction fee

3. What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?

	/// the prepare phase refers to the accessing of the information of the AuthAccount while the execute phase is where our code will be executed
(like calling functions and changing the information inside the contract)
