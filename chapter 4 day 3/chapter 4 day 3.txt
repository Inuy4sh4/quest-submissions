

 1.   Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.

First of all, it makes owning an nft from the same collection a lot easier and second of all, the dApp cannot mint us the nft because only we can do that.

2.    What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")

Destroy the resource using a destroy function inside the child functions!

3.    Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

        Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.
	
	Is this a stealth or a whitelist mint? Maybe a whitelist interface where we check certain events or interactions with other protocols are required.

        Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?
		Using references would be better!
