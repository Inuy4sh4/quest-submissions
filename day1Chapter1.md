    Blockchains are ledgers that get updated through blocks. The best example is Bitcoin, which is open for everyone, decentralized (not owned by a certain entity), immutable (cannot be altered), and transparent (all transactions are saved and explorable). The blockchain trilemma is that it can only have two of the following three qualities: Security, Decentralization and Scalability. 

 

    Smart contracts are pieces of code that get activated when certain conditions are met. They are faster, more secure and transparent because there is no middleman.  The cool thing that I learned about them while navigating the crypto space is that they are trustless. You don’t have to trust anyone because the code is the law! 

 

    Transactions are used to interact and modify the blockchain. Petting an Aavegotchi or swapping tokens alters the state of the blockchain and it requires a gas fee, thus making it a transaction. Scripts, on the other hand, are “read-only”, require no gas fee because they do not modify the blockchain, and are used to query instead.
