The first pillar is the Safety and Security: Making sure that datas are properly declared, eliminating vagueness and possible vulnerabilities, and the introduction of RoP.

The second pillar is represented by Clarity: Writing code in a way that it describes what we want to do, not how to do it, which makes the code easier to be read and audited.

The third pillar is Approachability: It resembles other programming languages so that the transition of web2 knowledge to the web3 space is easier.

The fourth pillar, Developer Experience: Clear error messages help, not confuse, the developers in their debugging process.

The final pillar, RoP: Will complete at the end of the course if I don't forget to!
