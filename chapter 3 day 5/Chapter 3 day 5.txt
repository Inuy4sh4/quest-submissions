1.For today's quest, you will be looking at a contract and a script. You will be looking at 4 variables (a, b, c, d) and 3 functions (publicFunc, contractFunc, privateFunc) defined in SomeContract. In each AREA (1, 2, 3, and 4), I want you to do the following: for each variable (a, b, c, and d), tell me in which areas they can be read (read scope) and which areas they can be modified (write scope). For each function (publicFunc, contractFunc, and privateFunc), simply tell me where they can be called.

access(all) contract SomeContract {
    pub var testStruct: SomeStruct

    pub struct SomeStruct {

        //
        // 4 Variables
        //

        pub(set) var a: String  // from the start, we know that a is readable and writable everywhere.

        pub var b: String // can be read everywhere but can only be written in current and inner

        access(contract) var c: String // can be read in current, inner and containing contract, can be written in current and inner

        access(self) var d: String // can be read in current and inner, can be written in current and inner

        //
        // 3 Functions
        //

        pub fun publicFunc() {} // can be accessed everywhere

        access(contract) fun contractFunc() {} // current, inner and containing contract

        access(self) fun privateFunc() {} // current and inner

        }
    }

        return <- create SomeResource()
    }
